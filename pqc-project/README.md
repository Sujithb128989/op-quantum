# PQC Demonstration Suite: Data-in-Transit and Data-at-Rest

## 1. Project Objective

This project provides a hands-on demonstration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). It involves building two web servers: a standard server (Server A) and a PQC-hardened server (Server B) to allow for comparison and testing.

The demonstration is designed to show the difference in security between a server using traditional cryptography and one using next-generation post-quantum cryptography.

## 2. Setup and Execution

The setup and execution of this project involves several steps, including installing dependencies, building the servers, and running test scripts.
