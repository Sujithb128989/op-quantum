                Welcome to our demonstration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). In a world where quantum computers threaten to break our current encryption standards, PQC offers a new generation of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks.

            <p>
                This website is a showcase of PQC in action. We are running two versions of this site:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Server A (Standard):</strong> This server uses traditional cryptography, which is vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers.</li>
                <li><strong>Server B (PQC-hardened):</strong> This server uses PQC to protect data, both in transit and at rest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Explore the site and see the difference for yourself. You can also try our <a href="/messaging">secure messenger</a> to see PQC in action.
