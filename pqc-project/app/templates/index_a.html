    <h2>The Bedrock of Digital Trust: Classical Cryptography</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Standard Server. Every day, we rely on classical cryptography to protect our digital lives. When you see a lock icon in your browser, you're seeing this technology at work. It's the foundation of online banking, e-commerce, and private communication.
    </p>
    <p>
        This server uses **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** with the **RSA algorithm**, a widely trusted public-key encryption standard.
    </p>

    <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public & Private Keys:</strong> RSA uses a pair of keys. A public key is shared with everyone, and a private key is kept secret. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the private key.</li>
        <li><strong>The Security Assumption:</strong> The security of RSA relies on a simple fact: it is incredibly difficult for today's computers to figure out the private key from the public key. This is based on the mathematical challenge of factoring very large numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Oncoming Challenge</h3>
    <p>
        While robust today, the foundation of classical cryptography is threatened by the development of quantum computers. These future machines will be able to solve the mathematical problems behind RSA with ease, rendering this form of encryption obsolete.
    </p>
    <p>
        This server represents the "before" picture: strong by today's standards, but vulnerable to the future.
